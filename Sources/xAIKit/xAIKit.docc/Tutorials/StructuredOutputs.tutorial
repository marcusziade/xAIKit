        Learn how to use structured outputs to get consistent, type-safe JSON responses from AI models. Build a SwiftUI app that extracts structured data from unstructured text.
        
        Note: xAI currently supports `json_object` response format, which guarantees JSON output. Full schema validation with `json_schema` is available for OpenAI-compatible APIs. xAI's beta parse API with Pydantic-style schemas is not yet implemented in this SDK.

    @Section(title: "Understanding Structured Outputs") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Structured outputs ensure that AI responses follow a specific format, making them easier to parse and use in your applications. There are two main approaches:
            
            **1. `json_object` format** (supported by xAI): Guarantees JSON output but relies on prompting for structure.
            
            **2. `json_schema` format** (OpenAI-compatible): Enforces strict schema validation.
            
            In this tutorial, you'll build a recipe parser app that extracts structured recipe data from plain text descriptions.

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Create a new SwiftUI app project and add xAIKit as a dependency.
                
                @Code(name: "Package.swift", file: "structured-01-setup.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Define your data models that represent the structured output you want to receive.
                
                @Code(name: "Models.swift", file: "structured-02-models.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Create a view model that uses xAIKit to extract structured data from text. Note how we use `json_object` format with detailed prompting for xAI, and show the commented `json_schema` approach for OpenAI-compatible APIs.
                
                @Code(name: "RecipeParserViewModel.swift", file: "structured-03-viewmodel.swift")
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "Building the UI") {

            Now let's create a SwiftUI interface that allows users to input recipe text and see the extracted structured data.
            
            @Image(source: "smart-assistant", alt: "Recipe parser UI")
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Create the main content view with a text editor for recipe input.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: "structured-04-contentview.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add a view to display the parsed recipe data in a structured format.
                
                @Code(name: "RecipeDetailView.swift", file: "structured-05-detailview.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Connect everything in your app's entry point.
                
                @Code(name: "RecipeParserApp.swift", file: "structured-06-app.swift")
            }
        }
    }

                Update the model to handle more complex recipe data with nutritional information.
                
                @Code(name: "AdvancedModels.swift", file: "structured-07-advanced-models.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Enhance the view model to request more detailed structured data.
                
                @Code(name: "AdvancedViewModel.swift", file: "structured-08-advanced-viewmodel.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Create a comprehensive view to display all the structured data.
                
                @Code(name: "AdvancedRecipeView.swift", file: "structured-09-advanced-view.swift")
            }
