<details>
<summary>View example</summary>

**Command:**
```bash
xai-cli messages create "What's the weather like today?" --model grok-3-fast
```

**Output:**
```
I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time data like current weather information since my knowledge is up to date only until October 2023. However, I can help you find out the weather by suggesting ways to check it!

- **Use a weather app**: Apps like Weather Underground, AccuWeather, or the default weather app on your phone can give you up-to-date information based on your location.
- **Check online**: Websites like weather.com or bbc.com/weather allow you to search for your city or zip code.
- **Ask a virtual assistant**: If you're using a device with a virtual assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them directly for the current weather.
- **Local news**: Tuning into a local news channel or radio station often provides weather updates.

If you tell me your location, I can guide you to a specific resource or let you know about typical weather patterns for that area based on historical data. Where are you located?

Revised prompt: A high-resolution photograph of a serene mountain landscape at sunset, featuring a calm lake that reflects the vibrant colors of the sky. The mountains are silhouetted against a backdrop of deep oranges and purples, with a few clouds enhancing the sunset's beauty. The lake is surrounded by trees that line its edges, adding depth to the scene without distracting from the main focus. The overall composition emphasizes tranquility and natural beauty, with no additional foreground elements to maintain the focus on the sunset and the lake. The scene is devoid of any human presence or modern elements, preserving the untouched nature of the setting.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Model Selection Guide

- **grok-4-0709**: Most capable model for complex reasoning and analysis
- **grok-3-fast**: Balanced performance and speed for general tasks
- **grok-3-mini-fast**: Fastest responses for simple queries
- **grok-2-image-1212**: Image generation capabilities
- **grok-2-vision-1212**: Image analysis and understanding

### Performance Optimization

1. Use streaming for long responses to improve perceived latency
2. Choose appropriate models based on task complexity
3. Adjust temperature (0-2) for consistency vs creativity:
   - Lower values (0-0.5): More focused and deterministic
   - Higher values (1.5-2): More creative and varied

### Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

- **Rate Limits**: Implement delays between requests
- **Timeouts**: Use streaming for long-running requests
- **Invalid Models**: Check available models with `xai-cli models list`
